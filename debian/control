Description: State Notation Language and Sequencer
 The Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System is a collection of
 tools, libraries and applications for creating a distributed soft real-time
 control systems.
 .
 This package contains the State Notation Language (SNL), which is a domain
 specific programming language that smoothly integrates with and depends and
 builds on EPICS base. This project defines SNL and provides an
 implementation, consisting of the SNL compiler and runtime system.
